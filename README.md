## Problem Statement
Atliq Grands, a prominent chain of five-star hotels across India, has been struggling to maintain its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel sector. Despite their 20 years of experience in the hospitality industry, strategic moves by competitors and ineffective management decisions have impacted their performance. To regain their market share and revenue, the managing director of Atliq Grands decided to incorporate Business and Data Intelligence. However, the company lacks an in-house data analytics team, so they hired a third-party service provider to gain insights from their historical data.

## Task List
As a data analyst, you have been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to complete the following tasks:

1. Create the metrics according to the metric list.
2. Develop a dashboard based on the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
3. Generate additional relevant insights not specified in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

## Learnings from the Project
- **New Visual Creation:** Developed a Calendar visual using a matrix table, which can be utilized for various analytical purposes.
- **Cancellation Policies:** Analyzed different hotel cancellation policies, noting that most hotels charge zero fees if the booking is canceled three months before the booking date. Charges range from 60% to 90% of the booking cost if canceled afterward.
- **Tooltips, Bookmarks and Selection:** Utilized bookmarks and selection for page navigation and clear filter button functionalities. This technique was learned from various tutorials and resources.
